# The main way to detect user input is with the "input" command #

	println Hello  $name !;

# The console or DevScript console from the editor waits for input until the user presses ENTER #
# Similar to the Java Scanner #

# Another method is to use the pre defined variable "keyPressed" #
# ATTENTION!! THIS VARIABLE IS ONLY AVAILABLE IF THE SCRIPT IS EXECUTED IN THE DEVSCRIPT EDITOR CONSOLE! #

# If you want to create a game, its also a good idea to #
# use a separate thread with a loop to detect key changes. This way you avoid input lag #
# Take a look at: Examples > demos > Snake Game ! #
