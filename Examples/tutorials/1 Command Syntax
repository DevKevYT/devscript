#[EXAMPLE 1: BASIC COMMAND SYNTAX]#

#
As you can see, you can put comments in your script by putting the text in between two "hashtags"
Comments are being completely ignored, so you can put them basically everywhere.
#

#In general, there is a command, that accepts certain arguments:
Here we have a "println" command, that accepts strings or any
other datatype. All commands are separated by a ";" and arguments are separated by a space character.
You can use the "help" command to list all available commands and their arguments#
	help;
	println "Hello";


#Strings are also recognized without the Quotation marks:#
	println Hello;


#But they are helpful if you want to pass Strings with spaces#
	println "Hello World";


#You can "wrap" multiple commands as arguments for other 
commands by putting the command in between "(" and ")"
Here, we add 2 and 2 (=4) and printing the result:
(Remember, the + is just another command, but the command name is
shifted to the right. Otherwise, it would look like this: "+ 2 2". Not very readable.#
	println (2 + 2);

#We can also do more complex command "wrapping" and print it
But remember, too much of something is never good better split this up with variables (Covered in example 2)#
	println (int ((random) * 1000));

#To format text, you can just put \n and \t inside strings#
	println "This is a line\nAnd another line. \tTab";
