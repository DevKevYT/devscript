General info for DevScript usage and how to get along in the tutorials

DevScript is based on commands and arguments of those commands, just like any CLI.
An example in Linux of a command would be:

	echo "Hello World"
	
Where "Hello World" would be a String parsed to the command "echo".
When speaking about commands in DevScript, the name of the command is always in lower case,
and arguments to the command are written in capital letters and wrapped in either [ ] or < >

	println [STRING]
	
This would be the simplest form of command that accepts a string as argument.
But when you print the command syntax using the "help" DevScript command, the println command looks a little different:

	help;

Output: println [ARRAY_ANY]
This Data type [ARRAY_ANY] may seem confusing at first. This just means that the command
accepts any data type wheter it is an array or not.

So, DevScript has a few data types (Found in com.devkev.devscript.raw.ProcessUtils.Type enum)
	NULL("null"), 
	STRING("string"), 
	BOOLEAN("boolean"),
	BLOCK("block"), 
	ANY("?"), 
	NATIVE_OBJECT("obj")
	CONTINUE("...")
	ARRAY_ANY("???"),
	INTEGER("int"), 
	FLOAT("float"), 
	NUMBER("num");
