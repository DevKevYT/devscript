# You can also use try/catch blocks to catch potential errors in your script #
# The try/catch syntax is similar like most programming languages: #

try {
	some command that does not exist;
	
} catch error {	# <- "error" is the variable name of the exception. You can choose any name you like #
	println "The error was: " $error;
};

# And if you want to keep things very simple, you can use a try block standalone: #

try {
	exec "cls";
};
try {
	gui.clear;
};

# This try example is useful if you want to clear the console but you dont know if the script is #
# executed in the console (gui.* commands not available) or the DevScript editor #
